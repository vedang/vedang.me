# This file contains a list of shell commands that I've found handy in situations
# I've faced over time. These are commands that _I_ have used (successfully).
# I'm not claiming that this is the only way or even the right
# way to handle a particular situation that you may face. YMMV.

# The commands are ordered by type rather than difficulty, so you are going to
# find intermediate and slightly advanced commands intermingled with the easy
# ones. I mean for this document to be used as a cheat-sheet, not a tutorial,
# but if you are confused about something shoot me a mail

* Redirection
  # How do I redirect the output of a process to a log file, and
  # background the process at the same time?
  - some_cmd > some_file 2>&1 &
  # How to I capture both STDOUT as well as STDERR in a file for
  # analysis?
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/692000/how-do-i-write-stderr-to-a-file-while-using-tee-with-a-pipe/692407#692407
  - some_cmd > >(tee -a stdout.log) 2> >(tee -a stderr.log >&2)

* Shell shortcuts
  # Copy the last command on the shell
  - !!
  # Copy the nth command on the shell
  - !N
  # Copy the last argument of the previous command
  - !$ or Esc .
  # Just print any command in history starting with something. eg: rsync:p
  - :p
  # Expand the variable
  - C-M-e or ESC C-e
  # Search through previous command history
  - C-r
  # Copy all args of the last command
  - !*
  # Delete backwards
  - C-w
  # Replace old with new in the previous command
  - ^old^new
  # Exansions across multiple folders. eg: cp handlers/{user,site,profile}/ .
  - {}
  # Get specific arguments from previous commands (with pos/neg count)
  - M-.
  # Show matching expansions
  - M-=
  # Expand hostname
  - M-@
  # Comment out the command
  - M-#

* Info
  # To install a downloaded info file to a dir file. Note, if dir does
  # not exist, install-info will create it properly.
  - install-info --info-file=sicp.info --dir-file=dir
* Find tips and tricks
  # How do I run a command in all directories under the current directory?
  - find . -maxdepth 1 -type d \( ! -name . \) -print0 | xargs -0 -L1 sh -c 'echo "Working in $0" && cd "$0" && git fetch origin'
  - find . -maxdepth 1 -type d \( ! -name . \) -exec sh -c 'echo "Working in $0" && cd "$0" && git fetch origin'
  # How do I list all files of *.h and *.cc?
  - find . \( -name "*.h" -o -name "*.cc" \) -print
* Shell + Emacs
  # How do I redirect the output of a shell command into Emacs for editing?
  - command | (f=$(mktemp); cat > $f; emacsclient $f; rm -v $f)
  - command | (f=$(mktemp); cat > $f; emacsclient $f; cat $f)
  # How do I run a shell command from inside Emacs?
  - Run M-! in Emacs
* Process utils
- ps -eTp
- /usr/share/bcc/tools/cachetop
- /usr/share/bcc/tools/filetop -s writes -p `pgrep mongod`
- sudo perf record -F99 -p `pgrep mongod`-g -- sleep 120
- procs as a replacement for ps
* Sum numbers in shell
  - <cmd> | paste -sd+ - | bc
* SSH break bad connection
- Press ~. on the shell
* NTP: fix the date on your machine
- Install =ntp= and =ntpdate=
  + sudo apt install ntp ntpdate
- Sync time with ntpdate
  + sudo ntpdate 0.us.pool.ntp.org
- If you see an error that ntp socket is already in use, turn off ntpd
  (that is generally what is running on 123 port)
  + ps ax | grep ntpd
  + sudo kill <pid>
- This should sync your time correctly with the ntp servers.
