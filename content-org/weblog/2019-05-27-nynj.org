   - Shakespeare in the Park is a *free* performance of select
     Shakespeare plays performed by the Public Theater every day in
     Summer. This year, they are performing _Much Ado About Nothing_
     from May 21st to June 23rd.
   - The way to get tickets is to stand in line at the Delacorte
     Theater (open air theater inside Central Park) on the morning of
     the performance you want to attend. The tickets tend to run out
     by 10:30 am. The show is at 8 pm.
   - You need to register and create an account at the Public Theater
     here:
     https://publictheater.org/Programs--Events/Shakespeare-in-the-Park/register/.
     This gives you a Patron ID that you need when buying tickets.
