* Good things
- Onboarding was beautiful. As a software dev, I learnt a lot about
  how to do this well.
  + Templates to help you set up teams and projects.
  + Videos explaining the basics.
  + The account login choice (between Google login and email/password
    login) was limited, but the switch was seamless.
- Automatic check-ins are great!
  + The interface and ux is intuitive and makes it easy to follow-up /
    collate / discuss updates across time and / or multiple people.
- Todos and scheduling is cool!
  + I like the UX, need to spend more time playing with these features
    to understand +/- points.
* Bad things
- Campfire
  + No ability to instantly modify your status.
    - I want to let people know what I'm doing. Examples:
      + "Bathroom Break"
      + "AFK for lunch"
      + "On the phone"
    - For a tool helping remote employees, this seems like a big miss.
  + No ability to add reactions in Campfire. Coming from Slack, this
    is a huge step back in the "fun" component.
- Docs and Files
  + Writing in Basecamp is not substantially better or different from
    writing in Confluence. I had expected that Basecamp would support
