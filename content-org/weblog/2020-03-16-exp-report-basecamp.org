* Good things
- Onboarding was beautiful. As a software dev, I learnt a lot about
  how to do this well.
  + Templates to help you set up teams and projects.
  + Videos explaining the basics.
  + The account login choice (between Google login and email/password
    login) was limited, but the switch was seamless.
* Bad things
- No ability to instantly modify your status.
  + I want to let people know what I'm doing. Examples:
    - "Bathroom Break"
    - "AFK for lunch"
    - "On the phone"
  + For a tool helping remote employees, this seems like a big miss.
- No ability to add reactions in Campfire. Coming from Slack, this is
  a huge step back in the "fun" component.
