#+subtitle: Organizing your planning in org-mode.

* Points
  - Gantt charts are a very effective planning tool
  - Everyone ends up on gantt charts:
    + manually maintain an excel sheet
    + use professional (and expensive) tool for all or part of your
      project planning: MS Project, Project Plan 365.
  - Wouldn't it be great to have this in plain text?
    + mermaidjs
    + ^ Great tool. Easy to write plain text gantt charts and see the
      visualization.
    + Where do we store this information? I want it to be a part of
      the day to day work I'm doing.
  - Enter org-mode
    + Incredible tool for personal planning, note taking, task tracking
    + Missing visualization tools, but has all the tools to hook things together.
    + Let's get to work connecting org-mode and mermaidjs
  - What we get
    + Add source blocks anywhere in your org-file, as you would normally do.
    + All the data is available for you to read within context.
    + Dealing with dates in Org is a breeze.
  - What are the pain points?
    + Tangle the org-file, Process the generated file, Evaluate the processed file
      - Too many manual steps
    + Adding new sections means you have to remember to add the
      section to the tangle block in the correct order.
  - What is missing
    + Being able to add a leave for 2 days in the middle of a planned
      project and have relevant plans automatically adjust. Need to
      check if tools support this.
