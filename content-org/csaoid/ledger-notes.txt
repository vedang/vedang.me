# This file contains a list of ledger commands that I've found handy in situations
# I've faced over time. These are commands that _I_ have used (successfully).
# I'm not claiming that this is the only way or even the right
# way to handle a particular situation that you may face. YMMV.

# The commands are ordered by type rather than difficulty, so you are going to
# find intermediate and slightly advanced commands intermingled with the easy
# ones. I mean for this document to be used as a cheat-sheet, not a tutorial,
# but if you are confused about something shoot me a mail

# *NOTE*: I use the aliases I've defined in all the commands.
* Ledger Aliases
  - alias lreport='/path/to/ledger/contrib/report'
    # ^ Reporting tool provided in ledger contrib
  - alias gledger='gpg -d /path/to/my-file.gpg | ledger -f -'
  - alias greport='gpg -d /path/to/my-file.gpg | lreport -f -'
    # ^ convenient for reading my encrypted ledger file.

* Listing and Display

    # ^ List all entries related to an account for a given period of time.
  - gledger reg account:name and @"payee:name" -p "from 2016/04/01 to 2017/04/01" -X Rs --real
    # ^ List all entries related to an account and a payee for a given period.
    # Useful for finding things like: Show me all the interest I earned in this period.
