      <p>Lily is a lifelong cooking enthusiast. She collected, cooked,
commented on, and critiqued thousands of recipes over the years - and
she did it before the age of the telephone (let alone the TV, the
computer or the internet).</p>

<p>The photo you see here is my 96 year old ajji (grandmother) Lila
Manerikar - lovingly referred to as Lily by her numerous
grandchildren.</p>

<p>I moved out of my parents&rsquo; home a year and a half ago, and learnt two
things quickly:</p>

<ol>
<li>I was an ungrateful son who never truly appreciated the work that
goes into setting a dinner table everyday.</li>
<li>I liked cooking. I liked the ritual of it, I loved the flavours,
and it helped me relax.</li>
</ol>

<p>My grandmother - and my parents - were pleasantly surprised to hear
about my newfound love of cooking. And then Lily said, &ldquo;Are you
interested in checking out my collection of recipes?&ldquo;. My grandmother
watched every cooking show she could (&ldquo;Vegetarian only, mind you.&rdquo;)
but I did not know that she collected recipes. I was more than happy
to go through her recipes.</p>

<p>These last years have been harsh on Lily. She lost her eyesight, and
has trouble moving around the house. She cannot cook anymore, but she
is delighted that I enjoy it, and suggests improvements to my recipes
when I describe my successes and missteps to her.</p>

<p>Sadly, we&rsquo;ve lost all but one box of Lily&rsquo;s recipes over the years.
Some to poor storage and some to bookworms. As she handed over this
final box of recipes to me, she said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I used to collect these recipes obsessively when I was young. You
kids have it easy: look at your phone and it will tell you how to
cook something, how it should look, what it should smell like. In my
time, gathering this knowledge was harder. These scraps may or may
not be useful to you, what with your fancy phone. If you find
something useful, great. Otherwise, throw them away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That last bit about &ldquo;throwing them away&rdquo; comes from a sense of drama
cultivated by watching a healthy dose of daily soaps and cooking shows
for decades. None-the-less, these clippings are precious to me. They
are a glimpse into the life of a person I&rsquo;ve never known - a young
woman who raised four kids on a teacher&rsquo;s salary. Someone who was a
long way off from being my grandmother. There are scribbles on the
sides, marking improvements and experiments over time. There are
postcards of recipes exchanged between my grandmom and her daughter -
studying cooking in a Banglorean college. There is the awe of looking
at something that is older than I am, and represents a bygone era.</p>

<p>I want Lily&rsquo;s legacy to live on in a small way, and to be accessible
to all her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. And so I&rsquo;m moving
these recipes online, out of reach of bookworms and moisture (I&rsquo;ll be
on the lookout for bitworms). I plan to cook the dishes, expand on the
annotations in the corners and raise a toast to my grandmother&rsquo;s
health as often as I can!</p>
