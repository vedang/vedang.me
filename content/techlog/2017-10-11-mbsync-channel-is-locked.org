You may come across the following error when running ~mbsync~ :

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Error: channel :<channel-name>-remote:<folder>-:<channel-name>-local:<folder> is locked
#+END_EXAMPLE

This happens when there is another ~mbsync~ instance running in
parallel and it has taken a lock on the particular folder. In my case,
I am running ~mbsync~ via a cron-job, and it tends to leave dead
instances around if the laptop sleeps during a run. Kill all instances
of ~mbsync~ and restart the process and you should be fine!
