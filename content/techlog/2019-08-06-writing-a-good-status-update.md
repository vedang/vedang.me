## What is the purpose of status updates? {#what-is-the-purpose-of-status-updates}

-   Let **your manager** know what you have achieved this week.
-   Let **your co-workers** know what you have achieved this week.
-   **Reflect** on your progress and pace **yourself**.


## Properties of good status updates {#properties-of-good-status-updates}

-   **Short** and **meaningful**. (5 min reading time)
-   Communicate **work in the previous week**, **highlight progress**
-   Communicate **plan for the next week**, **help make yourself efficient**
-   Communicate **open questions** and **blockers**, **highlight areas where we need to help you**


## Writing the status update {#writing-the-status-update}

-   We ask for status updates on every Monday. First thing Monday morning, spend time reviewing your last week and creating an update. Remember to review the status you had posted last week as well! You need to give updates about all of those tasks.


### Create sections for your updates {#create-sections-for-your-updates}

-   Use the following sections:
    -   What I did last week
    -   What I plan to do this week
    -   Questions / Action Items
-   This makes it **easy to parse** your update


### Name the project you are currently working on {#name-the-project-you-are-currently-working-on}

-   Yes, your manager is supposed to know what you are working on. But you often do many unplanned, extra tasks too. **Highlight them**.
-   Help your manager by making it easy for them to compile project reports.
-   This makes your update very readable.


### Name the milestone of the project you are currently working on. {#name-the-milestone-of-the-project-you-are-currently-working-on-dot}

-   Helps when we have to take a call about cutting or increasing scope on a project.
-   Highlights and reinforces upcoming co-ordination points.


### Your status update should definitively answer the following questions: {#your-status-update-should-definitively-answer-the-following-questions}

-   What are you working on?
-   For each project that you are working on, where are you? What is the next date that you are committing to?
-   Are you on track for the current phase of the project or not? If not, what is the impact on the overall project?


### Example status update {#example-status-update}


#### What I did last week: {#what-i-did-last-week}

-   Completed final PRD review for **Project X**, no open questions at this point! :yay:. Project is **on track**!
-   Pushed a fix to <ABC> to production and closed <jira>. Graphs show amazing reduction in bandwidth :epicwin: <link + screenshot>
-   Working on dev of **Project Y**. Project is **not on track** :sad_pepe:. We had communicated that dev will be complete by <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2019-08-02 Fri&gt;  </span></span>  but I will need 3 more days. This pushes the **new date to <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2019-08-07 Wed&gt;</span></span>** EOD.
-   Conducted the Enterprise initiative meeting, meeting notes are here: <link>


#### What I plan to do this week: {#what-i-plan-to-do-this-week}

-   I will have the initial estimates for **Project X** by EOD <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2019-08-08 Thu&gt;</span></span>
-   I will complete the Dev work on **Project Y** as mentioned above.
-   I will create a document about <DEF> as we had discussed by EOD <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2019-08-09 Fri&gt;</span></span>


#### Questions / Action Items: {#questions-action-items}

-   We need to sync up about ideas for implementing **Project X** before tomorrow EOD, but you don't have an empty meeting slot until day-after. What should we do?
-   I will inform <Frontend team-member> that **Project Y** integration testing cannot start tomorrow, instead it will start on <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2019-08-08 Thu&gt;</span></span>


## What do you get from writing a good update? {#what-do-you-get-from-writing-a-good-update}

-   A **record of work for yourself**. This is invaluable come performance review time. You only have to read through 26 updates and you have a thorough summary.
-   **Help your manager** advocate for you during appraisals. You should care about your career more than anyone else.
-   **Help yourself**. Writing the update should **give you** a clear idea of your own progress and what you need to work on.
