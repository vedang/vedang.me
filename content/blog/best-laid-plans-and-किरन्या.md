-   14th August.
-   wifey is staying at her parents tonight, because there's a pooja she
    needs to perform early next morning.
-   looking forward to a long uninterrupted work session, followed by a
    relaxed tuesday.
-   "Vedang, you should go to Akku Maushi's place today." Why? It's
    Gokulashtami today!
-   Okay, I'll leave early and take the Bullet. I'll beat the ridiculous
    traffic, go meet Akku Maushi and Shree Kaka, offer my prayers and
    leave in half an hour, be back home in two and a half hours total.
-   I also haven't driven the Bullet all this rainy season, so two birds
    with one stone! Vedang you're a genius.
-   I did leave early and I did beat the traffic! Yes! I was at Akku
    Maushi's home at 6 pm on the dot. I could be back home by 7:30 pm!
-   I imagined I would be alone. I was wrong. Many of my uncles and
    aunts were there. As was my mom!
-   So instead of leaving at 6:30 pm, I ended up staying till 7:30 pm.
    Not gonna lie, I was super pampered and loved every minute of it. It
    was fun talking to everyone.
-   "Vedang, since you're here, come home with me. Drop me home, have
    dinner and then leave."
-   "No, mother, I have work to finish today. If I stay for dinner then
    it'll be too late getting back home and I won't get anything done."
-   "Okay, then drop me to Swargate so that I can catch a bus home."
    "Yes, will do."
-   As we approach the Swargate bus station, we see the 21 number bus
    that would have taken my Aai home leave. We've missed the bus by a
    minute! I wait with my mother and chat about everyone at home until
    the next bus arrives. It's 8:30 pm now.
-   Okay, mom's on her way home. Now let's ride home and get to work!
-   No! No! No! the bullet's out of petrol!
-   Okay no worries,
