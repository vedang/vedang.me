Once upon a time I had a blog. Then one day I ran out of motivation,
inclination, desire, drive, whatnot to post to that blog. I never
really ran out of content though. At least, I think not.

I worried that I'd drown this world in my drivel, but lately I've come
to realise that no one gives a shit. So I'm going to write for the
right reasons: Because it makes me happy. Stick around, and I'll try
not to bore you. Or leave. I don't give a shit.
