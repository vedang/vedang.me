### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Shakespeare in the park. {#shakespeare-in-the-park-dot}

-   Shakespeare in the Park is a **free** performance of select
    Shakespeare plays performed by the Public Theater every day in
    Summer. This year, they are performing <span class="underline">Much Ado About Nothing</span>
    from May 21st to June 23rd.
-   The way to get tickets is to stand in line at the Delacorte
    Theater (open air theater inside Central Park) on the morning of
    the performance you want to attend. The tickets tend to run out
    by 10:30 am. The show is at 8 pm.
-   You need to register and create an account at the Public Theater
    here:
    <https://publictheater.org/Programs--Events/Shakespeare-in-the-Park/register/>.
    This gives you a Patron ID that you need when buying tickets.

        stops.
