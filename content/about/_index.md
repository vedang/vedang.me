Hi! I'm Vedang. I live in Pune, India and work at Helpshift. I'm
passionate about programming, and some of my work can be found on
GitHub. I use Emacs as my editor-for-everything, and blog about it
from time to time.

I love reading books, and I write book reviews once in a while. I also
have strong personal opinions on mythology and culture, and I use this
space to try and convert random strangers to my point of view.

If you want to get in touch, please send me a message here:
