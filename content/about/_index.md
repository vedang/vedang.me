Hi! I'm Vedang. I live in Pune, India and work at
[Helpshift](https://helpshift.com). I'm passionate about programming,
and some of my work can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/vedang). I use Emacs as my
editor-for-everything, and blog about it from time to time.

I love reading books, and I write book reviews once in a while. I also
have strong personal
[opinions on mythology](https://vedang.me/tags/mythology/) and
culture, and I use this space to try and convert random strangers to
my point of view.

If you want to get in touch, please send me a message at
vedang.manerikar on Google's email service.
