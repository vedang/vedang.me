Hi! I'm Vedang. I live in Pune, India and work at [Helpshift](https://helpshift.com). Now a
days, I'm an Engineering Manager working on improving processes and
workflows within the Helpshift Core backend team with the help of my
team mates. Previously, I was an individual contributor and helped
design and write some of the code that runs Helpshift.

I'm passionate about programming, and some of my work can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/vedang). I use Emacs as my editor-for-everything, and blog about it
from time to time.

I love talking about technology. If you're talking about distributed
systems, programming languages, performance, data structures, Emacs,
Git, do call me over!

I love reading books, and I write book reviews once in a while. I also
have strong personal [opinions on mythology](https://vedang.me/categories/mythology/) and culture, and I use this
space to try and convert random strangers to my point of view.

If you want to get in touch, please send me a message at
vedang.manerikar on Google's email service.
