_Snippet from: [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.in/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B078Y98RG8/), along with my own notes_

Flow
: Maximizing the rate of flow of work is the key to success.
    Limiting the work in progress is the fastest way to achieve Flow.


Fast Feedback
: Setup systems to get fast feedback at every stage
    of work, from concept through shipping to maintaining in production.


Experimentation and Learning
: Keep dedicated time for experiments,
    at every level of the company. A culture of innovation is necessary
    for achieving and maintaining Flow and Feedback.
