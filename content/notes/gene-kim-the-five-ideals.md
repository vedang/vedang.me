_Snippet from: [The Unicorn Project](https://www.amazon.in/Unicorn-Project-Developers-Disruption-Thriving-ebook/dp/B07QT9QR41), along with my own notes_

The First Ideal
: _**Locality and Simplicity**_. Build simple,
    decoupled systems that can iterate in isolation.


The Second Ideal
: _**Focus, Flow and Joy**_. Work in small batches
    with fast and continuous feedback.


The Third Ideal
: _**Improvement of Daily Work**_. Make sure that daily
    work can be done with minimum impediments. Prioritize productivity
    over everything else.


The Fourth Ideal
: _**Psychological Safety**_. Solving problems
    requires preventing problems, which requires honesty, which requires
    the absence of fear.


The Fifth Ideal
: _**Customer Focus**_. Build only that which
    actually matters to our customers.
