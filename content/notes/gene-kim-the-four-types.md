_Snippet from: [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.in/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B078Y98RG8/), along with my own notes_

Business Projects
: "Feature Work". This is the most visible type
    of work.


Internal IT Projects
: Release Automation, QA Automation, Developer
    Tooling and other internal enablers. Mostly un-tracked and
    invisible, but crucial to long-term success.


Updates and Changes
: Generally generated from above to categories
    of work. Introduces delay as breadth of existing surface area
    increases.


Unplanned Work
: Fire-fighting at all levels of the company. Ruins
    planned work, so root causes need to be aggressively remediated.
