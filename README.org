#+title: Vedang's Static website Generator
#+date: <2022-08-29 Mon>

This repository contains the contents of my website as well as the code to generate the website from the contents.

All posts are represented in Markdown format under the ~components/content/resources/content~ folder. These are generated by exporting my ~org-mode~ files using [[https://github.com/vedang/ox-neuron][ox-neuron]]. The following files are exported to the folder:

1. ~blogposts.org~
2. ~wisdom.org~
3. ~bb-scripts/README.org~

**@TODO**: Automate the export and capture it as a ~bb~ task.

You can see the currently supported tasks by running ~bb tasks~ on the CLI from the root folder. Currently, the output looks like this:

#+begin_example
> bb tasks
The following tasks are available:

print-opts    Helper task to print the options we pass around
clean         Remove all the generated files in the public directory
clean-content Remove the content directory. *WARN*: Are you sure?
prep-content  Create the content and assets directories. (Necessary before export).
render        Build the HTML and CSS files in the public directory.
serve         Start the http-server for local testing
watch         Watch the directory for changes and re-render on change
#+end_example
