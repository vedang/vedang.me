#+title: Vedang's Static website Generator
#+date: <2022-08-29 Mon>

This repository contains the contents of my website as well as the code to generate the website from the contents.

All posts are represented in Markdown format under the ~content~ folder. These are generated by exporting my ~org-mode~ files using [[https://github.com/vedang/ox-neuron][ox-neuron]]. The following files are exported to the folder:

1. ~blogposts.org~
2. ~wisdom.org~
3. ~bb-scripts/README.org~

**@TODO**: Automate the export and capture it as a ~bb~ task.

* Explanation of the current ~bb~ tasks
** ~prep-content~
This task cleans up the content directory and prepares it for a fresh export from ~org-mode~.
