Also, REBL requires a license for commercial use.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a handy reference to getting started with REBL if your primary workflow is Leiningen/nrepl, so here is the series of things I had to do to get the REBL up and running for myself.
Download the REBL jar from Cognitect.
Use lein-localrepo to install the REBL jar to your m2.</description></item><item><title>Compiling and Running Emacs 28 from the native-comp feature branch (Ubuntu 20.04).</title><link>https://vedang.me/tinylog/emacs-28-native-comp-ubuntu-20-04/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 12:35:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vedang.me/tinylog/emacs-28-native-comp-ubuntu-20-04/</guid><description>Quick Note: How to compile Emacs 28.0.5 from source with native compilation: https://t.co/29vNNkGQoU

Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.
Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don&amp;rsquo;t clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don&amp;rsquo;t insist on interactive input.
Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks.</description></item><item><title>ESR: the UNIX Philosophy</title><link>https://vedang.me/notes/esr-unix-philosophy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 18:11:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vedang.me/notes/esr-unix-philosophy/</guid><description>Snippet from: The Art of Unix Programming
Rule of Modularity Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces. Rule of Clarity Clarity is better than cleverness. Rule of Composition Design programs to be connected to other programs. Rule of Separation Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines. Rule of Simplicity Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must. Rule of Parsimony Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.</description></item><item><title>Gene Kim: The Five Ideals of DevOps</title><link>https://vedang.me/notes/gene-kim-the-five-ideals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 18:11:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vedang.me/notes/gene-kim-the-five-ideals/</guid><description>Snippet from: The Unicorn Project, along with my own notes
The First Ideal Locality and Simplicity. Build simple, decoupled systems that can iterate in isolation. The Second Ideal Focus, Flow and Joy. Work in small batches with fast and continuous feedback. The Third Ideal Improvement of Daily Work. Make sure that daily work can be done with minimum impediments. Prioritize productivity over everything else. The Fourth Ideal Psychological Safety.

No Speed Hacks You can&amp;rsquo;t tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don&amp;rsquo;t try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you&amp;rsquo;ve proven that&amp;rsquo;s where the bottleneck is. Measure before tuning Don&amp;rsquo;t tune for speed until you&amp;rsquo;ve measured, and even then don&amp;rsquo;t unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest. No Fancy Algorithms Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small.</description></item><item><title>Tim Peters: The Python Way</title><link>https://vedang.me/notes/tim-peters-the-python-way/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 18:11:52 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vedang.me/notes/tim-peters-the-python-way/</guid><description>Snippet from: The Python Mailing List
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren&amp;rsquo;t special enough to break the rules.

Summary It is a myth that technology only advances. We&amp;rsquo;ve often seen significant backward slides in tech. (Lots of examples to illustrate this point) Software is in decline. Both software robustness and programmer productivity is declining. (Lots of examples to illustrate this point) We need to fight complexity and strive for simplicity in every step if we want to battle degradation and loss of capability.</description></item><item><title>Lily's Recipes</title><link>https://vedang.me/projects/lilys-recipes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 19:03:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vedang.me/projects/lilys-recipes/</guid><description>Lily is a lifelong cooking enthusiast.

He published a love-letter to Clojure this weekend, and I think it is an absolute must-read for all programmers (whether you write Clojure or not). The blog-post covers the following areas:

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Engineering quality is paramount. Focus on &lt;a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2019/07/09/clear-is-better-than-clever">clean and clear code&lt;/a>.
Code is the primary medium of communication for any engineer.
Write beautiful code and hold people to high standards.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding head count has vast hidden costs and often brings down
output. The reason for this is the exponential increase in
communication required to align everyone to common goals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Similarly, pods cannot scale unless they can own small,
independent components.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monoliths are normal and good when the company is small.
Refactoring the monolithic model into different components allows
us to scale pods and org.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Carve monoliths only when it hits critical mass. Then, identify
the pain and pull it out into it&amp;rsquo;s own pod.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Relationship as a service&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Please get this done for me over
and above other stuff on your plate&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Traffic congestion&amp;rdquo; (A team which is too busy) and structural
failure can lead to the impression that the system is
bureaucratic and political.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Criteria when hiring Engineers
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Computer science (Can computers understand your code?)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ability to grasp large complex systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understanding of implications of design choices on that system.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Software Engineering (Can humans understand your code?)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How well do you communicate through your code? This is the
metric that enables building &lt;strong>good&lt;/strong> systems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The hygiene you show in code is the hygiene you will enforce
on others.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Good behavioral traits (Can you grow?)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Curious&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wants to learn&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can accept feedback&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Strong opinions, Weakly held.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Pride without attachment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>A year ago, I went to the Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) in Mundhwa, Pune
to get my passport renewed. At the time, the government had revamped
this process and made it a simple, step-in/step-out painless affair.
Unfortunately for me, I hit an edge-case in the system and took much
longer than expected to complete. I was there for close to 4 hours. I
used this time to observe the behavior of the PSK and think about
ways to improve the applicant experience. I thought it was an
interesting problem to solve and write about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, my wife booked an appointment at the PSK to renew &lt;span class="underline">her&lt;/span>
passport and this provided the spark I needed to write about it. So
here we are, a year later, talking about the passport renewal process
at the PSK.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tinylog: Mbsync: Error: Channel &lt;x> Is Locked</title><link>https://vedang.me/tinylog/mbsync-channel-is-locked/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2017 19:22:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://vedang.me/tinylog/mbsync-channel-is-locked/</guid><description>You may come across the following error when running mbsync :
