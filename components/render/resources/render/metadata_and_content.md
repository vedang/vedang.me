## Year of learning: Online courses, newsletters, subscriptions {#year-of-learning-online-courses-newsletters-subscriptions}

This post serves as a collection of resources I learn from, or want to learn from. I would love a subscription to these resources as a gift. I also hope this list will be useful to others! I hope you use it alongside my list of book recommendations on various topics to upskill yourself!

If you wish to send me a gift subscription, please note that my email address is **ved dot manerikar at google's email service**
