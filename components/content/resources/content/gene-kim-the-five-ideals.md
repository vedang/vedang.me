_Snippet from: [The Unicorn Project](https://www.amazon.in/Unicorn-Project-Developers-Disruption-Thriving-ebook/dp/B07QT9QR41), along with my own notes_

-   **The First Ideal** : _**Locality and Simplicity**_. Build simple, decoupled systems that can iterate in isolation.

-   **The Second Ideal** : _**Focus, Flow and Joy**_. Work in small batches with fast and continuous feedback.

-   **The Third Ideal** : _**Improvement of Daily Work**_. Make sure that daily work can be done with minimum impediments. Prioritize productivity over everything else.

-   **The Fourth Ideal** : _**Psychological Safety**_. Solving problems requires preventing problems, which requires honesty, which requires the absence of fear.

-   **The Fifth Ideal** : _**Customer Focus**_. Build only that which actually matters to our customers.
