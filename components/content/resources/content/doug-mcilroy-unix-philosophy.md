_Snippet from: [The Art of Unix Programming](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch01s06.html)_

-   **Make each program do one thing well**. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.

-   **Expect the output of every program to become the input to another**, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.

-   **Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks**. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.

-   **Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task**, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.
