Hi! I'm Vedang. I live in Pune, India and work at [Helpshift](https://helpshift.com). Now a days, I work in improving Developer Productivity inside Helpshift. Previously, I was an Engineering leader working on improving processes and workflows within the Helpshift backend team with the help of my team mates. I helped design and write some of the code that runs Helpshift.

I'm passionate about programming, and some of my work can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/vedang). I use Emacs as my editor-for-everything, and blog about it from time to time.

I love talking about technology. If you're talking about distributed systems, programming languages, performance, data structures, Emacs, Git, do call me over!

I love reading books, and I write book reviews once in a while. I also have strong personal [opinions on mythology](https://vedang.me/mahabharata.html) and culture, and I use this space to try and convert random strangers to my point of view.

If you want to get in touch, please send me a message at vedang.manerikar on Google's email service.
