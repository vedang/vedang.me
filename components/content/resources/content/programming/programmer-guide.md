Over the weekend, I created a poster for my desk. It captures timeless best practices and advice on programming and software design. Presenting it here, in the hopes that it'll be useful to others as well. Features: [@esrtweet](https://twitter.com/esrtweet), Doug McIlroy, [@rob_pike](https://twitter.com/rob_pike) and [@RealGeneKim](https://twitter.com/RealGeneKim)
