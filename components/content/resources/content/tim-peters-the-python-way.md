_Snippet from: [The Python Mailing List](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/1999-June/001951.html)_

-   Beautiful is better than ugly.

-   Explicit is better than implicit.

-   Simple is better than complex.

-   Complex is better than complicated.

-   Flat is better than nested.

-   Sparse is better than dense.

-   Readability counts.

-   Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

-   Although practicality beats purity.

-   Errors should never pass silently.

-   Unless explicitly silenced.

-   In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

-   There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it.

-   Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

-   Now is better than never.

-   Although never is often better than **right** now.

-   If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

-   If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

-   Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
