_Snippet from [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/)_

-   **Lead Time** : Length of time between when the code is committed and when it is deployed to production. Smaller is better.
-   **Mean Time to Recover** : Length of time from incident start to incident end. Smaller is better.
-   **Change Failure Rate** : Number of deployments to production that need hotfixes. Smaller is better.
-   **Deployment Frequency** : Number of times new code (not hotfixes) is deployed to production. Larger is better.

Improving these metrics directly results in huge performance boosts for developer productivity.
