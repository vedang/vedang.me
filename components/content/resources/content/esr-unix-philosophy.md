_Snippet from: [The Art of Unix Programming](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch01s06.html)_

-   **Rule of Modularity** : Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
-   **Rule of Clarity** : Clarity is better than cleverness.
-   **Rule of Composition** : Design programs to be connected to other programs.
-   **Rule of Separation** : Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
-   **Rule of Simplicity** : Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
-   **Rule of Parsimony** : Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
-   **Rule of Transparency** : Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
-   **Rule of Robustness** : Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
-   **Rule of Representation** : Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.
-   **Rule of Least Surprise** : In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
-   **Rule of Silence** : When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
-   **Rule of Repair** : When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
-   **Rule of Economy** : Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
-   **Rule of Generation** : Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
-   **Rule of Optimization** : Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
-   **Rule of Diversity** : Distrust all claims for the "one true way".
-   **Rule of Extensibility** : Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
