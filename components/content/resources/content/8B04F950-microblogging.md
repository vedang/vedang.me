    The first day of #NaNoWriMo was spent updating my notes. Basically, copying my mastodon.technology toots into my personal notes, because there isn't a way to import them here. Lesson learned: Capture all micro-blogging efforts into my PKM, and find a way to publish them separately as well.

    Hello fellow Emacsen!

    Pros of Musk buying Twitter: It's uplifting to see someone so powerful fail so spectacularly.

    Perhaps the trick to becoming better is fail fast, not care about public shaming, and keep improving.

    Cons: I don't want Twitter to die. I like it and will be sad to see it go.

    I've asked for an archive of my Twitter data, but then I realised that I don't need it! (through a series of lucky choices).

    I've been using Pinboard for all my bookmarking since 2016. It has a feature which saves all my tweets as bookmarks!

    It also has a great API, which means downloading those tweets for local storage was straightforward.

    Thanks @Pinboard, @idlewords!

    And here is the code I used 3 years ago to download my #pinboard bookmarks for local storage (#emacs, #orgmode). Ran it again now and it worked like a charm :) <https://github.com/mathcass/pinboard-org>

    Every time I have to debug Docker / Podman issues, I end up wondering why I ever stopped using vagrant and simple VM boxes.

    I guess I just haven't figured out the knack to debugging Docker issues yet.

    Woke up to a Youtube Premium notice saying they were unable to charge my credit card and my subscription will end soon. This e-mandate business had been working well for a year now, but has suddenly failed. What an unnecessary waste of time this is!

    Dear Google, just gimme one place from which I can pre-pay you manually for all the services I use, ideally for many years at once. Make it work with UPI. Why have you made <span class="underline">taking</span> my money so hard!

    Dear RBI, **please** work with major players to figure out what the hell is happening. Your e-mandates were working fine, now suddenly they are not, and I don't know what to do. Or just gimme a place where I can sign to declare that I'm an adult and can mange my own credit.

    Every year, I'm so grateful for the effort that goes into #adventofcode ! It's so much fun! Thank you @ericwastl :)

    As usual, I think about solving the problem in some new language, but I end up doing it in #Clojure

    A long time ago, I wrote a small document on what a programming editor should be able to do.

    It was part of a course where I was teaching Emacs, and I realised that I don't care about what editor you use as long as you can do these things in the editor.

    Today, someone asked me to share the document with them again, so here I am, sharing it with everyone. My request: Please reply with more / missing functionality that you think is must-have in an editor. PRs welcome!

    At Helpshift, we were in a crunch and unable to hire fast enough. So we converted all the QAs to Devs in the Backend team. It was the best decision we took. Not only were the QA excellent Devs themselves, they brought a different perspective to Devs and made the Devs better.

    Today, I believe that QA should exist to build end-to-end automated testing suites, fuzzers, performance benchmarking and other high value add-ons for all engineering. Their job is to build the tools that enable devs to test in creative ways and fail fast.

    \#Emacs Tip of the day: Opening a file as root (screenshot attached).

    Image: ![](./static/ox-hugo/Screenshot 2023-01-12 at 3.17.44 PM.png) Alt-text: An image of the emacs-lisp function `uf/sudo-edit`, for editing a file as root from inside Emacs. Taken from: <https://github.com/vedang/emacs-up/blob/a42dd0638842cbcba2d1a98ab784eacd66d0ab0a/site-lisp/utility-functions.el#L139-L147>

    If you `M-x uf/sudo-edit`, it will ask for a filename and open it as root. If you `C-u M-x uf/sudo-edit`, it will reopen the file visited by the current buffer as root.

    Happy Republic Day. 73 years ago today, the Constitution of #India came into effect and we became a sovereign democratic republic, the largest and most vibrant democracy in the world. Our Constitution was and continues to remain ahead of it's time: an ideal of political, economic and societal reform that we have yet to achieve.

    Thank you üôè to Babasaheb Ambedkar, BN Rau and the unsung heroes and heroines of the Constituent Assembly for the blood, sweat and tears they poured into drafting something so farsighted and inspirational.

    May we forever uphold the values of a true Republic Nation.

    WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a **SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC** and to secure to all its citizens:

    JUSTICE, social, economic and political;

    LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;

    EQUALITY of status and of opportunity;

    and to promote among them all

    FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;

    IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.

    What beautiful phrasing @vgr -- "the ability to doubt is not reducible to text"

    Dubito, ergo Cogito, ergo Sum is one of the deep philosophies I hold close to heart. And even so the act of it is completely non-trivial and so, so difficult.

    I wrote a document that I thought was good, and then I read it out loud and realised it wasn't. Reading out loud helped me see the flow of the writing and the abrupt breaks and repetitions in it.

    This is a pro-tip that I will not forget the next time. #writing

    Reading through this short and sweet paper on live programming <https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06777>, I realised that it's been 10+ years since @worrydream's classic talks "Inventing on Principle" and "The Future of Programming". I remember seeing them and being blown away.

    I thought then, and still do, that #Clojure was the perfect scaffolding language to bring that vision to life.
