Flow
: Maximizing the rate of flow of work is the key to success. Limiting the work in progress is the fastest way to achieve Flow.


Fast Feedback
: Setup systems to get fast feedback at every stage of work, from concept through shipping to maintaining in production.


Experimentation and Learning
: Keep dedicated time for experiments, at every level of the company. A culture of innovation is necessary for achieving and maintaining Flow and Feedback.
