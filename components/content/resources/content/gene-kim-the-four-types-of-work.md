_Snippet from: [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.in/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B078Y98RG8/), along with my own notes_

-   **Business Projects** : "Feature Work". This is the most visible type of work.

-   **Internal IT Projects** : Release Automation, QA Automation, Developer Tooling and other internal enablers. Mostly un-tracked and invisible, but crucial to long-term success.

-   **Updates and Changes** : Generally generated from above two categories of work. Introduces delay as breadth of existing surface area increases.

-   **Unplanned Work** : Fire-fighting at all levels of the company. Ruins planned work, so root causes need to be aggressively remediated.
