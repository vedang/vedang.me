I'm Vedang. I live in Pune, India and work at [Helpshift](http://helpshift.com). I'm passionate about programming, and some of my work can be found on [GitHub](http://github.com/vedang). I use [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) as my editor-for-everything, and consider it the one true religion. More information on my professional life can be found on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/vedangmanerikar)

I used to write a diary in my schooldays, and I've carried that tradition forward by maintaining a weblog. I can't promise exciting tales of high adventure, but I shot down an alien spacecraft last Thursday. Books are a big part of my life. I'm quite proud of my personal collection of 450+ books - and growing. I write a book-review every once in a while, and these are also posted on my weblog.

I listen to a wide range of music - right from Marathi classical to English rock. I prefer music from the earlier "golden" era over current generation music. My favorite genre is classic rock. My three favorite bands are The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Velvet Underground - in that order. If you buy me any memorabilia of these bands, I'll invite you home for dinner.
