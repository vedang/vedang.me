Once upon a time I had a blog. Then one day I ran out of motivation, inclination, desire, drive, whatnot to post to that blog. I never really ran out of content though. At least, I think not.

("Ask him to write a post, he goes "No, Thank you", but ask him to ramble endlessly in an Alt Text...")] %}

I worried that I'd drown this world in my drivel, but lately I've come to realise that no one gives a shit. So I'm going to write for the right reasons: Because it makes me happy. Stick around, and I'll try not to bore you. Or leave. I don't give a shit.
