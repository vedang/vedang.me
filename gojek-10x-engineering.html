The reason for this is the exponential increase in communication required to align everyone to common goals.</li><li>Similarly, pods cannot scale unless they can own small, independent components.</li><li>Monoliths are normal and good when the company is small.

The person with the back-channel to the blocked system gets to jump the queue. This inherently does not scale because people without the relationship back-channel get more and more frustrated.</li><li>"Our organization is political." I don't have privileged access, therefore that other guy must be master politician.</li><li><strong>The actual underlying problem is traffic congestion.

A good engineer has strong opinions weakly held.<ul><li>You should be able to change your opinion on being presented facts.</li></ul></li><li>If you are unable to deal with criticism of your code, that's a smell.<ul><li>We ask junior people to interview senior engineers. This shows the grace they have when dealing with others.</li></ul></li><li>We routinely wind up in situations where you have young people owning complex systems. Senior engineers need to be hired to now deal with these systems, and they will be on-boarded by juniors. They should be able to deal with this fact.</li><li>CTO: "When I lay out a design, I expect people to give me rational criticism so that I can learn from them."</li><li>If you had to hire someone with deep experience vs great behavioral foundations, what would you choose?<ul><li>It Depends!</li><li>Sometimes, you need to bring deep experience to the table to build something out and learn from the guru.</li><li>Behavioral traits means that someone is teachable. Outside the Valley, this is extremely important because of the lack of access to experienced engineering.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="onboarding-engineering-bootcamp">Onboarding / Engineering bootcamp</h2><ul><li>Structured decision making</li><li>Basic coding hygiene</li><li>Collaboration<ul><li>How do you engage with someone else to meaningfully decide reasonably quickly what something in code should be.</li></ul></li><li>Heavy focus on coding during the bootcamp.</li><li>We bring in coaches from <strong>every team</strong> and teach. (regardless of hire). This helps us build empathy, which is critical for future collaboration.</li><li>Pride without attachment.<ul><li>Pride allows you to focus on creating beautiful code.</li><li>Attachment means you will stand in the way of the evolution of your beautiful baby. You need to let it go and let others change it.</li><li>If you look back at code you wrote 6 months back and don't notice how bad you were, you aren't growing.</li></ul></li><li>Repeat the same problem every Monday throughout the whole bootcamp. Ask them to review every week and see if they find that feeling of progress.</li></ul><h2 id="gojek-culture">Gojek culture</h2><ul><li>Even the most high-performing team has to deal with intense time pressure.</li><li>What makes or breaks teams under pressure?<ul><li>Show them the impact that they are making.</li><li>You don't need to push engineers, you need to give them the rush! External force will not drive the maker as much as the impact of work will.</li><li>The value you create is not proportional to the time you put in, it's proportional to the state of your mind in that time you put in.<ul><li>If you are burned out, or your team mate is burned out then there is going to be a huge negative spiral.</li></ul></li><li>To harness creativity, you need balance and psychological safety. The hours that you put in, you need to be in a state of flow. This requires you to take short breaks after days of intense activity.</li></ul></li><li>You can have a 10x engineer amidst you, but you may never know it because you did not give them sufficient leeway to unleash their art.</li></ul><p></div> </div> </div></p></div><div id="post-last-updated"><p><i>Last Updated: 2019-07-20T07:39:00Z</i></p></div><hr /><div id="post-parents"><div id="post-links"><h1>Parents</h1><ul><li><span>2023-05-24</span><span> - </span><a href="/notes.html">Notes</a></li></ul></div></div><hr /><div id="post-tags"><h1 class="links-header">Tags</h1><div class="flex"><div class="inline-flex"><a href="/tags/gojek.html">gojek</a><span class="mx-2">|</span></div><div class="inline-flex"><a href="/tags/culture.html">culture</a><span class="mx-2">|</span></div><div class="inline-flex"><a href="/tags/engineering-management.html">engineering-management</a><span class="mx-2">|</span></div><div class="inline-flex"><a href="/tags/notes.html">notes</a><span class="mx-2"></span></div></div></div><nav class="bottom-0 right-0 float-right mb-6" id="post-nav"><a class="px-2" href="/index.html">Archive</a><a class="px-2" href="https://github.com/vedang/vedang.me/blob/master/components/content/resources/content/notes/gojek-10x-engineering.md" target="_blank">Discuss this post</a></nav><nav class="bottom-0 left-0 float-left mb-6" id="copyright-nav"><p>Except where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a>.</p><p>Built with ❤️, using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a>, <a href="https://clojure.org/index">Clojure</a>, <a href="https://babashka.org/">Babashka</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>, <a href="https://prismjs.com/">PrismJS</a></p></nav></div></body></html>
